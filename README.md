# MATLAB Neural Network

This repository contains all the MATLAB source code files I created while learning about neural networks during my 6th semester of college. Each experiment is designed to explore different aspects of neural networks, from basic operations to advanced applications.

## Experiments Overview

- **Experiment 1**: Study of Neural Network Toolboxes
- **Experiment 2**: Study of MATLAB Functions
- **Experiment 3**: Basic Matrix Operations
- **Experiment 4**: Plotting in MATLAB
- **Experiment 5**: Activation Functions in Neural Networks
- **Experiment 6**: Hard Limit Transfer Function
- **Experiment 7**: XOR Function with McCulloch-Pitts Neural Network
- **Experiment 8**: AND-NOT Function with McCulloch-Pitts Neural Network
- **Experiment 9**: Hebbian Network for 2D Input Pattern Classification
- **Experiment 10**: Perceptron Net for AND Function with Bipolar Inputs and Targets

## Getting Started

To run these MATLAB scripts, you will need MATLAB installed on your computer. Clone this repository and open the files in MATLAB to execute the experiments.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SudoKMaar/sem6-neural-network.git
cd sem6-neural-network
```

## Usage

Each folder in the repository corresponds to an experiment. Navigate to the experiment folder and run the MATLAB script associated with that experiment.

```bash
cd Experiment_1
matlab -r "run('Experiment 3.m')"
```
